- Emulates a terminal version of a centralised banking database.
- Uses a PostgreSQL database to manage transactions.
- Uses JDBC to mediate transactions between the user interface and the PostgreSQL database.
- Allows for deposition, withdrawal and transfers of money between accounts via account numbers and sort codes.
- Allows for the checking of balance and transaction histories for individual accounts.
- A backend.sql file is provided to initialise the database, except individual mileage may vary dependent on administrative permissions to postgres servers.
- For personal use, it would be recommended to alter the connection specifics in the main method to better reflect one's own arrangements.

- TODO: Add a more visually appealing and user-friendly front-end to the project.
